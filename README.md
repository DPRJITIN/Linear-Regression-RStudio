# Linear Regression Model: A Step-by-Step Guide in RStudio

 This project demonstrates a step-by-step guide to building a linear regression model using the Iris dataset in R. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset that contains measurements of different flower species. Our objective is to predict the Sepal Length of the flowers based on other variables such as Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

The project includes loading and exploring the dataset, splitting the data into training and testing sets, building and training the linear regression model, making predictions, evaluating the model's performance using RMSE, and visualising the results with scatter plots and residual lines. The visualisations help to assess the model's accuracy and identify any discrepancies between actual and predicted values.
